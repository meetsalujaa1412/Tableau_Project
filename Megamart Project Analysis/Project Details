Megamart Project Analysis
Project Overview
Project Name: Megamart Project Analysis


Project Description
Megamart is a global retail store that offers a wide range of products to consumers worldwide. The company operates exclusively through Sales Agents, who are responsible for selling products to customers. Each Sales Agent is assigned specific product categories to focus on. For example, Eli Kavanagh may be responsible for selling products in categories such as Laptops, Kids' Clothing, and Kitchen Tools.

The Sales Manager at Megamart has expressed the need for a comprehensive sales dashboard that revolves around the performance of Sales Agents. The dashboard should allow the Sales Manager to select a particular Sales Agent and a specific sales month. Once selected, the dashboard should provide the following insights:

Key Features
1. Sales for the Agent Every Month
Display the total sales revenue generated by the selected Sales Agent for each month.
Visualize the sales trends over time to identify patterns and seasonality.
2. Scatterplot of Quantity vs. Sales by Product Category
Create a scatterplot that shows the relationship between the quantity of products sold and the corresponding sales revenue for each product category.
This scatterplot will help identify which product categories have the highest sales relative to the quantity sold.
3. Top 10 SKUs by Sales of the Selected Month
Generate a list of the top 10 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) with the highest sales in the selected month.
Provide detailed information about each SKU, including product name, category, and sales amount.
4. Top 5 Product Categories by Sales of the Selected Month
Identify the top 5 product categories with the highest sales revenue in the selected month.
Show a breakdown of sales within these categories to understand which product types are driving revenue.
5. Sales Agent Performance Tracking
Allow the Sales Manager to input a sales target for the selected Sales Agent.
Display the progress of the Sales Agent towards their sales target for the chosen month.
Provide insights into whether the Sales Agent is exceeding, meeting, or falling short of the target.
Data Sources and Processing
This project will involve joining multiple datasets in a left join format to gather the necessary information about sales, agents, products, and categories. Data preprocessing will include cleaning, transforming, and enriching the data as required.
